# Nimbus: AI-Powered Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis

## Description
Nimbus is an AI system that utilizes image analysis to detect subtle patterns in histological images, enabling early and precise colorectal cancer diagnosis. By leveraging deep learning, Nimbus improves patient outcomes through rapid and accurate detection.

## Features
âœ… AI-driven colorectal cancer detection from histological images  
âœ… High accuracy using deep learning models  
âœ… Early detection for improved patient outcomes  
âœ… Designed for seamless integration in medical workflows  
âœ… User-friendly interface for pathologists and researchers  
âœ… Secure and privacy-focused data handling

## How It Works
1. **Upload Image** â€“ Users upload a histological image of a tissue sample.  
2. **AI Analysis** â€“ The deep learning model processes the image and detects cancerous patterns.  
3. **Diagnosis Output** â€“ The app provides a detailed report, including the probability of colorectal cancer.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python (3.8+)
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abj360/nimbus-app.git
cd nimbus-app
```

---

## Usage
1. Open the Google Colab notebook in the repository.
2. Run the notebook to execute the AI model.
3. Upload a histological image of a tissue sample.
4. Wait for the AI model to analyze the image.
5. Receive a detailed diagnosis report.
